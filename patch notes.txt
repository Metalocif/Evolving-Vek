v1.4.2
- Added a missing tip for the Tyrannical prefix
- Fixed the bug with prefixing emerging enemies for the third time or so.

v1.4.1
- Added tutorial tips that explain what each prefix does when they first appear in game.

v1.4
- Prefixed enemy spawns are finally working.
- Undying enemies have their corpses disappear if they die in water.
  - Corpses can still be pushed into water and stay there just fine, but this should help.
- Added a failsafe to prevent an infinite loop if too many prefixes were disabled and none are valid.
- Added the following prefixes: Frenzied, Freezing, Venomous.
- Nerfed Heavy. It now lowers MS by 2 instead of 1. Max HP is highly visible to the player, a difference of 1 MS is not.
- Fixes to Webbing and Wrathful.

v1.3
- Added a mod option to prevent deterministic prefixes (Vek on fire -> Fireproof) and make them random instead.
- Added the following prefixes: Brood, Webbing, Mirroring, Pushing, Groundbreaking.
  - I can now modify skill effects!
- Probably fixed an issue occuring on save reload.

v1.2.1
- Should have fixed a long-standing bug by rerolling prefixes when it occurs.
  - This bug was made invisible to the player by preventing prefixing when it occured in v1.1.
  - So this should only make more prefixed Vek appear.
  - I cannot stress enough how weird this bug is, but at least it's handled, if not fixed.
- Added pings where a prefixed Vek appears to make the player aware of them. Alerts didn't work for some reason.
- Fixed an issue where Healing Vek would not heal adjacent Vek corpses back to life.
- Fixed an issue where Wrathful Vek would lose their Boost status after queueing the attack.
- Flying pawns can't be prefixed with Massive anymore.

v1.2
- Added the following prefixes: Cannibalistic, Spiteful, Copying (melee and ranged versions).
- Added upgraded versions of the Tyrannical weapon so that things that upgrade Vek weapons can upgrade it.
  - AFAIK this is only my Rock Leader.

v1.1.3
- Fixed a bug caused by a missing value for mod.

v1.1.2
- Removed leftover debug stuff.

v1.1.1
- Added a failsafe to spawn alteration.

v1.1
- Added the following prefixes: Burrowing, Light, Splitting, Oozing, Infectious, Regenerating, Wrathful, Tyrannical.
  - Figured out a cool trick to trigger effects at the start of a prefixed Vek's movement, enabling most of the above.
- Armored, Volatile, and four of the new ones can be given if a condition is met (psion presence/goo boss mission).
- Added mod options to individually disable prefixes and alter prefixing conditions.
  - This also serves as a way to explain in-game what each prefix actually does.
- May have fixed a strange bug where some prefixed Vek were not found in _G.
  - It seemed the bug only triggered when I tried altering two Vek in the same missionStartHook.
  - So I only prefix one at the start of a mission; less overwhelming this way anyway.
  - Added an extra failsafe for it, just in case.
- Related: prefixed enemies at the start of a mission correctly emerge instead of standing in their starting tile.
- Vek that are frozen at the end of a mission no longer become evolved Vek.

v1.0
- Release.
- Added the following prefixes: Stable, Fireproof, Smokeproof, Leaping, Armored, Volatile, Heavy, Massive, Undying, Ruinous, Purifying, Healing.
