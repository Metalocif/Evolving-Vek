v1.1.2
- Removed leftover debug stuff.

v1.1.1
- Added a failsafe to spawn alteration.

v1.1
- Added the following prefixes: Burrowing, Light, Splitting, Oozing, Infectious, Regenerating, Wrathful, Tyrannical.
  - Figured out a cool trick to trigger effects at the start of a prefixed Vek's movement, enabling most of the above.
- Armored, Volatile, and four of the new ones can be given if a condition is met (psion presence/goo boss mission).
- Added mod options to individually disable prefixes and alter prefixing conditions.
  - This also serves as a way to explain in-game what each prefix actually does.
- May have fixed a strange bug where some prefixed Vek were not found in _G.
  - It seemed the bug only triggered when I tried altering two Vek in the same missionStartHook.
  - So I only prefix one at the start of a mission; less overwhelming this way anyway.
  - Added an extra failsafe for it, just in case.
- Related: prefixed enemies at the start of a mission correctly emerge instead of standing in their starting tile.
- Vek that are frozen at the end of a mission no longer become evolved Vek.
